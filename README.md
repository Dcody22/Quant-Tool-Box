# Drake's Quant Projects
Quant_Tool_Box.py contains classes to implement the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and a probability of default model that is based off the Black-Scholes framework. 

Quant_Tool_Box_Example.py shows how each method in both the Black-Scholes model and probability of default model are used. 

If you use this code or would like to see any models added, please messege me on linkedIn here https://www.linkedin.com/in/drake-cody-0a1001125/.
